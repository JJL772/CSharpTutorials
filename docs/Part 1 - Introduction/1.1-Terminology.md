#Terminology

####Computer
A computer is defined as a device that can perform operations automatically. For the purposes of this tutorial, a computer will only include devices which use electrical pulses to perform these operations. (Sorry no mechanical computers here bud!)

####Bit
A number in the binary number system, can be either a 1 or 0

####Byte
A collection of 8 bits

####Octet
A collection of 8 bits, basically a byte!

####Nibble
A collection of 4 bits, half of an octet.

####Emulation
Reproduction of a functional system by another software, instead of the actual thing. Think of the gameboy emulators that exist for PC, so you can play your favorite gameboy games without actually needing a gameboy.

####Virtual Machine
An emulation of a computer system. This can allow you to run a computer inside another computer, and perform some other cool operations.

####Explicit
Stated and explained clearly in detail, arguably one of the most important words in the field of computing.

####Implicit
Implied but not necessarily expressed, arguably one of the most important words in the field of computing.

####Machine Code
Code a computer can actually understand. This is comprised of numeric values which the computer can interpret as binary values.

####Byte Code
Similar to machine code, except that it is usually interpreted by something other than the actual computer, like a virtual machine or other software.

####Compiler
This is a piece of software that converts human-readable code, like C#, into either bytecode or machine code. It acts as a translator between English and computer speak.

####Preprocessor
In a 2-step compiler, the first part that runs, removing any disabled code (such as comments) and expanding macros (if the language supports macros)

####Executable
The actual runnable piece of software produced as a result of code compilation, hence the name.

####Library
Also the result of code compilation, but this can't actually run, instead it provides functionality and is usable by other programs. Also known as Class Libraries in some languages.

####Memory
The part of the computer tasked with storing data.

####Volatile Memory
Memory that changes very frequently (will explain later).

####Non-Volatile Memory
Memory that doesn't change very frequently (will explain later).

####Processor
The part of the computer that handles execution and most operation. Basically the brain.

####Instruction
Tells the computer to perform an operation. Every program that is runnable by the hardware is composed of instructions which tell the processor what to do.
