##How do computers work anyways?
Computers are very complex devices, but they're not impossible to understand. Computers generally have numerous components such as: the processor, the RAM, the Hard Drive/SSD, the monitor/display device, the graphics accelerator (aka GPU), and more! Each of these components plays an important role in the function of the computer as a whole.
