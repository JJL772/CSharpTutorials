##How do computers work anyways?
Computers are extremely complex devices, but are not impossible to understand. Computers are very explicit devices, meaning they are like small children; they need to be told what to do, how to do it and when to do it. On the low-level side of things, very close to the hardware, very little, if anything at all, is implied. This allows the programmer to know exactly what's going on, so they can squeeze the best performance out of the hardware, or so they can perform some very specific actions. As you move away from the low-level side of things into higher-level programming, more things become implied and programming becomes less rigid.

##Computer Components
Here's a list of components that usually are in a computer.

|Component Name | Function |
|:-------------:|:--------:|
|Processor      | Does the actual processing in the computer |
|RAM            | Stores data for short-intermediate amounts of time, and gets cleared after computer restarts |
|HDD/SSD        | Persistant storage for the computer. Stores data for long periods of time, often for years or until the drive is discarded | 
|GPU/Graphics Accelerator | Provides the processing power needed to render stuff to the screen |
|Motherboard | The thing that allows devices in a computer to communicate with eachoter |
|Peripherals    | Other crap you usually plug into the computer |
