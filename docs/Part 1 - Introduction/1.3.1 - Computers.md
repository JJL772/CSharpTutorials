##How do computers work anyways?
Computers are extremely complex devices, but are not impossible to understand. Computers are very explicit devices, meaning they are like small children; they need to be told what to do, how to do it and when to do it. On the low-level side of things, very close to the hardware, very little, if anything at all, is implied. This allows the programmer to know exactly what's going on, so they can squeeze the best performance out of the hardware, or so they can perform some very specific actions. As you move away from the low-level side of things into higher-level programming, more things become implied and programming becomes less rigid.

##Computer Components
