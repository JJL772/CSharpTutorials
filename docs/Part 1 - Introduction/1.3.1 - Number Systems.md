#Number Systems
As you have learned in school, we use the decimal number system, which contains 10 different numbers, 0-9, which we can combine to produce any number we want. Computers don't use the decimal number system we do, as they can't represent 10 different numbers using simple electronics. Instead, computers use the binary number system, which uses bits to represent numbers. In addition, programmers often use the hexadecimal number system to represent large numbers. Learning these number systems is entirely necessary for programmers, as they're often used in conjunction with the decimal number system in software. You'll see the uses of these number systems in the future, especially when we get to bit-masking and extraction.
