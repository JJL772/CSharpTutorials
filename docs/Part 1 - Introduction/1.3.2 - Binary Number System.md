#Binary Number System
The binary number system, also known as the base-2 number system, is a number system initially developed and used all the way back in the Egyptian times. Today, the binary number system is scarecly used outside of the computer sciences, but inside the computer sciences, the binary number system is absolutely vital. The binary number system uses only two values, a 1 or a 0 to represent numbers, as hinted by the bi- in the name. Other than the different digits, counting in binary is nearly identical to counting in our decimal (base-10) number system.

#Why do we use binary?
The binary number system is used in the computer sciences because computers can only represent 0 or 1 reliably in memory and in the processor. Why? Computer memory uses switches which only have 2 states they can be in, on or off. This isn't always true, however, quantum computers for instance, use qbits, which can store any number of possible values. Until we can buy quantum computers, we won't be using anything but binary. Not only that, but binary is incredibly easy to understand for certain tasks, which we will get into later. Trust me, you'll be glad for binary.

#Counting in Binary
Counting in binary is very similar to counting in decimal. Here's a table of decimal numbers 0-20 mapped to their binary counterparts.
