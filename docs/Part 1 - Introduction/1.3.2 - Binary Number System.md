#Binary Number System
The binary number system, also known as the base-2 number system, is a number system initially developed and used all the way back in the Egyptian times. Today, the binary number system is scarecly used outside of the computer sciences, but inside the computer sciences, the binary number system is absolutely vital. The binary number system uses only two values, a 1 or a 0 to represent numbers, as hinted by the bi- in the name. Other than the different digits, counting in binary is nearly identical to counting in our decimal (base-10) number system.

#Why do we use binary?
The binary number system is used in the computer sciences because computers can only represent 0 or 1 reliably in memory and in the processor. Why? Computer memory uses switches which only have 2 states they can be in, on or off. This isn't always true, however, quantum computers for instance, use qbits, which can store any number of possible values. Until we can buy quantum computers, we won't be using anything but binary. Not only that, but binary is incredibly easy to understand for certain tasks, which we will get into later. Trust me, you'll be glad for binary.

#Counting in Binary
Counting in binary is very similar to counting in decimal. Here's a table of decimal numbers 0-20 mapped to their binary counterparts.

| Binary | Decimal |
|:------:|:-------:|
| 0 | 0 |
| 1 | 1 |
| 10 | 2 |
| 11 | 3 |
| 100 | 4 |
| 101 | 5 |
| 110 | 6 |
| 111 | 7 |
| 1000 | 8 |
| 1001 | 9 |
| 1010 | 10 |
| 1011 | 11 |
| 1100 | 12 |
| 1101 | 13 |
| 1110 | 14 |
| 1111 | 15 |
| 10000 | 16 |
| 10001 | 17 |
| 10010 | 18 |
| 10011 | 19 |
| 10100 | 20 |

Hopefully you can see a pattern in this table, if not, here's how the pattern goes. For this, we will call each place in the number string a bit, as it should be called. If we start at `0` and increment the value, we will get `1`, if we increment again we will get `10`. Why? When we fill up the least significant bit's (the furthest right bit) value we will then increment the next most significant bit's (the bit to the left of this one) value. So when we count to `1`, we can't add any more numbers to this bit's place, so we will then increment the next most significant bit's value, resulting in the value `10` or 2 in decimal. If we want to count up again, we will perform a similar operation. We will then try to increment the lest significant bit's value, giving us the result `11` or 3 in decimal. But what's next? Simple, we repeat the operation, we will try to increment the lest significant bit's value, but that fails, so we will set it to `0`, then move onto the next bit and try to increment it. That too will fail, so we set the value of that bit to `0`. We will now move onto the next position, which is the furthest right. When we try to increment this value, it will succeed, and we have completed our operation, resulting in a binary value of `100` or 4 in decimal.

Here is a step by step procedure to count in binary:
Note: Failing to increment a value is defined as trying to increase that bit's value when having that bit already equal `1`, so that it can't equal anything greater. In other words, try to add 1 onto the bit's value, but if it results in a value greater than `1` it's a failure.
|:-----:|
| Try to increment the least significant bit's value |
| If that fails, set this bit's value to `0` and try to increment the next most significant bit's value |
| Continue until you can increment a value successfully |
