#Hexadecimal Number System 
The hexadecimal number system is another number system commonly used by programmers. It uses a total of 16 characters to count, as opposed to just 10 characters in the normal decimal system. The characters used are numbers 0-9 and letters A-F. Where each increasing character represents another value. For reference, here's a table of those letters and their mapped values:

| Hex Number | Decimal Number |
|:----------:|:--------------:|
| 0 | 0 |
| 1 | 1 |
| 2 | 2 |
| 3 | 3 |
| 4 | 4 |
| 5 | 5 |
| 6 | 6 |
| 7 | 7 |
| 8 | 8 |
| 9 | 9 |
| A | 10|
| B | 11 |
| C | 12 |
| D | 13 |
| E | 14 |
| F | 15 |

Note: Hex numbers are often denoted by a 0x preceding the sequence of numbers. For example 0x1 or 0xF would be hex numbers.
