#The Processor
The processor is the core of the computer. It executes programs, carries out operations that it's told to do, manages memory and does a lot more important stuff. Without the processor, the computer would be a useless pile of components.

#What does it do?
As stated above, the processor's main goal is to perform operations that it's told to do. The processor handles operations like: execution of programs, memory management and communication between other components in the computer. This is just the tip of the iceberg, however, as there are many more functions the processor carries out.

#The anatomy of a processor
The processor contains numerous sub-systems, but there's a few major ones. First of all, we have the CU, or control unit, which is basically the core of the core. It handles all operations fed to it via instructions. The processor also has the ALU, or arithmetic logic unit, which performs all arithmetic operations and most logical operations too. Finally, we have the MMU, or memory management unit, which handles memory-related tasks, such as allocating memory and storing addresses. Because we're so cool writing this tutorial, and we want to feel very hip indeed, here's this table:

|Component|Function|
|:---------:|:--------:|
| CU (Control unit) | Controls the processor and stuff |
| ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) | Uses fancy logic to evaluate simple math operations |
| MMU (Memory Management Unit) | Performs memory related operations |

The processor also has some on-chip storage spaces, which are known as registers. These registers come in limited quantity and are usually small in size, only the width of memory addresses on that archetecture, for example 32 bits. However, registers are extremely fast. To access these registers, the processor wastes few clock cycles, as they're located directly on the chip itself. Where as the main memory requires tens or even hundreds of clock cycles to access.

#But How does it work?
The processor is a detailed and complex piece of precision-engineered equipment, with trillions of transistors, each of which are usually less than 40nm wide (very freaking small). The smart computer architects and other engineers work to design these devices in such a way that they are programmable using machine code. The way you tell a processor to do something on the low level side of things is by using instructions. Each processor implements what's known as an instruction set, or a set of instructions provided by a computer archetecture. One of the most common computer archetectures in 8086, which is abbreviated x86, and the 64bit version of this archetecture is abbreviated x86-64 or just x64. Each archetecture has a standard for which instructions should be implemented and what those instructions should do. Each of these instructions has a numeric code associated with it. When the processor is fed that code it will try to perform an operation that it is hard coded to do.

The processor has on board memory too, called registers. These registers are very small, only 32bits wide on 32bit systems, or 64bits wide on 64bit systems. These registers are also used by instructions usually to take parameters.
