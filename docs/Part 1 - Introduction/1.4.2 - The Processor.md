#The Processor
The processor is the core of the computer. It executes programs, carries out operations that it's told to do, manages memory and does a lot more important stuff. Without the processor, the computer would be a useless pile of components.

#What does it do?
As stated above, the processor's main goal is to perform operations that it's told to do. The processor handles operations like: execution of programs, memory management and communication between other components in the computer. This is just the tip of the iceberg, however, as there are many more functions the processor carries out.

#How does it work?
The processor is a detailed and complex piece of precision-engineered equipment, with trillions of transistors, each of which are usually less than 40nm wide (very freaking small). The smart computer architects and other engineers work to design these devices in such a way that they are programmable using machine code. The way you tell a processor to do something on the low level side of things is by using instructions. Each processor implements what's known as an instruction set, or a set of instructions provided by a computer archetecture. One of the most common computer archetectures in 8086, which is abbreviated x86, and the 64bit version of this archetecture is abbreviated x86-64 or just x64. Each archetecture has a standard for which instructions should be implemented and what those instructions should do. Each of these instructions has a numeric code associated with it. When the processor is fed that code it will try to perform an operation that it is hard coded to do.

The processor has on board memory too, called registers. These registers are very small, only 32bits wide on 32bit systems, or 64bits wide on 64bit systems. These registers are also used by instructions usually to take parameters.
