#The Memory
"Without memory, one is living only in the present, with no future nor past. Basically, you're just useless"
-Jeremy L. (me)
As a wise man once said, memory is an important construct, and without it, one cannot serve a purpose in life. Much like a person without memory, a computer will be useless without memory. I consider memory to be one of the 2 most important parts of a computer, next to the processor.
