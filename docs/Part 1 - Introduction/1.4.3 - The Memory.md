#The Memory
"Without memory, one is as useless as a rock is edible"
-Me

The memory of a computer is one of the most important things in a computer, without it, a computer can't function, and the processor, at best, can serve as a simple calculator.

#Volatile vs Non-Volatile Memory
For the untrained eye, memory all looks the same, but it's important to know the different types of memory, how they work, when they're used and why they exist. The two main types of memory a computer uses are volatile and non-volatile memory, bother of which are extremely important.

The first type of memory is volatile memory, and is often referred to as RAM (Random Access Memory). This type of memory is temporary storage that is frequently written to and read from, the term volatile is used for this exact reason; it's constantly changing. This type of memory is also usually pretty small in size, sizing in around anywhere from just 4GB all the way up to 128GB, but it's small size is made up by its speed. It has bandwidth up into the hundreds of Gigabytes per second transfer speed, pretty insane compared to non-volatile memory.

The next type of memory we have is called non-volatile memory, known as this because it is less frequently written to. This type of memory often exists as your hard drive on your computer, or as your USB flashdrives. Compared to volatile memory, like RAM, it has the ability to store much more data, and the storage of this type of memory is often measured in the Terra-bytes, or thousands of gigabytes. However, the speed of non-volatile memory is quite lacking. Usually, most HDDs or even SSDs have speeds measured in the MB/s range, much slower than its very volatile counterpart.

For the purposes of this slide, we will talk only about volatile memory.

#Why is RAM used?
RAM stands for Random Access Memory, and is used to store program-specific data for short periods of time when these programs are executing. Because RAM has a high transfer speed, and also because the CPU can easily access it, the binary data of programs are stored in memory, along with the program's own data. If this type of stuff was stored on the HDD or some other type of slow non-volatile memory, it would act as a major bottleneck for the CPU. In essence, RAM is used to prevent bottlenecks for the entire computer.

#Memory Addressing
If all data is stored in memory, how is it accessed? Does the computer just know where it is? Nope! But the solution is simple, using memory addressing. Each byte of RAM in a computer has a corresponding address, this way, data can be moved in and out as well as referenced using this fixed, unchanging value representing a position in memory.

If you recall from earlier, a 32-bit computer can only have around 4GB of memory.
