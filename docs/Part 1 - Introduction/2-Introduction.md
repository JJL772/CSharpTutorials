#Introduction

##What is programming?
Programming is the creation of code and software to solve a problem or to fufill a need involving something related to computing. In other words, programming is essentially typing random stuff into a computer, hoping it works and pretending that what you wrote actually solves a problem. All jokes aside, programming really is just the act of telling what computers to do, using a language that the computer can understand. Contrary to popular thought, programming isn't just constantly writing code all day, every day, it involves a lot of thinking, planning, and usually, debugging. Later in this chapter, we will go over how a computer actually works.

##But what is C#?
C# (CSharp) is a high-level, C-Style, garbage collected, strongly-typed and object oriented programming language released by Microsoft in 2000. C# is also cross platform, uses a bytecode format, compiles quickly and runs using a JIT compiler provided by the .NET framework. If you're new to programming, you probably have no idea what I just wrote, but later, you most certainly will understand what it means.

###Why learn C#?
C# is a good language to first learn due to its simplicity, reusability and because it's widely used accross the software industy. Right now you might be thinking C# is complicated and difficult, but, as you will learn later, it's actually a really simple language and you will find it significantly easier than say, C++. Not only that, but it runs blazingly fast for a language of its type. Taking advantage of a JIT (Just-In-Time) compiler and a pre-compiled bytecode, it runs significantly faster than similar languages like Java, which uses a Virtual Machine. But wait! There's more! C# uses very little memory compared to Java AND it takes advantage of an optimizing compiler, meaning it's very difficult to write inefficient code. Overall, C# is an insanely useful language, and it's also a great starting point for the beginning programmer. So that's why you should use it!
